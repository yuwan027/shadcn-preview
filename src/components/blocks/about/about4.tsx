            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-xl font-medium leading-8">
              For years, the process of building custom software has remained
              challenging. Today, visual builders exist, but tailored solutions
              still require technical expertise and a lot of time. This is a
              problem for businesses and individuals alike.
              <br />
              <br />
              What if you could create custom software without writing a single
              line of code? What if you could build your own tools.
              <br />
              <br />
              With our platform, you can! Our tools let you design layouts and
              create functionality—all without needing to code.
              <br />
              <br />
              We believe that everyone should be able to build their own
              solutions, regardless of their technical background.
